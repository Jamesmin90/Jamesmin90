👋 Hi, I am James Min and here is what I am working on!

- ⚙️  I've just released a Flutter app called "CSM: Christian Students Munich", CSM is a Christian student club and they will use this app for all club activities such as: Bible studies, sports activities, event planning, and trips together. It is now being reviewed by the app store and play store so hopefully you all can check it out soon. If you would like to test out the beta please contact me by email 
- 👀 I’m interested in App development and NLP. 
- 🌱 I'm a computer linguistics student in the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, therefore, I am currently learning machine learning, machine translation and other aspects of NLP. In my free time I am always learning something new concerning app development. I would like to learn next about CI/CD to make updating and managing my apps much simpler. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an app development project that involves NLP.
